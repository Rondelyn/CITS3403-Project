## Application Desc:
This application has been designed to provide users with a platform to sign up and post images that can be tagged with categories in a fun and safe space (uncomfortable content can be reported for removal).
These are posts and are displayed on the feed page with a filter option to show only images with a matching tag.
Users can vote on these posts and the top 5 will be displayed in order on the home page.
From the home page, users can also select their preferred background colour for the site with a colour selector on the left of the page.
Feed and Post can only be accessed by logged-in users and will otherwise be redirected to the login page.
